  name: Sensor Light
  description: "# Sensor Light\n**Version: 2.6**\n\nThe most common automation used
    for a sensor light. The good thing is, with this automation you can turn ON as
    many lights as you like by selecting an Area, a Device, an Entity or just any
    combination you like using just one sensor to do it. BE CAREFUL when selecting
    an Area or a Device as it will turn On and OFF everything attached, lights, switches,
    etc.\n\nLet us know what you think of this blueprint and for community support
    including updates: [Click Here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/sensor-light/481048)\n\n**The
    Automation Process:**\n - In this example we will use a Motion sensor as the trigger
    but you can use one or multiple [Binary Sensors](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/binary_sensor/)
    as the trigger/s.\n - Triggers on a motion sensor and turns the lights ON. \n
    - When no motion is detected, a time delay is activated and turns the lights OFF
    Automatically.\n - The lights will stay ON if the motion sensor detects motion
    before the time delay turns the lights OFF. It will then reset the time delay
    after last motion is detected.\n - You have the option to select scenes. This
    allows you to turn ON a scene when motion is detected and turn OFF a scene when
    the time delay has ended.\n - You have the option to use the \"Light Control\".
    This allows you to set a brightness level for your lights.\n - You have the option
    to use the \"Trigger Sensor By-pass\". This allows you to add a switch to manually
    By-pass the trigger sensor so you can use the lights as normal by turning them
    ON and OFF manually.\n - You have the option to use the \"Sun Elevation\". This
    is used for adding a condition to only work when it is dark by setting the suns
    position to the horizon.\n - You have the option to set an Ambient Light Sensor
    and set the LUX value. This is used for adding a condition to only work when it
    is dark or below the Ambient Light LUX Value.\n - You have the option to set a
    start time, an end time and select weekdays. This will only allow the automation
    to run between the time periods.\n - You have the option to use the \"Zone - Device
    Tracker\". This can be useful if you have pets triggering the trigger sensor turning
    your lights ON and OFF when no one is home.\n - You have the option to use \"Night
    Lights\". It is normally used for having lower softer lights come ON when going
    to the bathroom at night.\n \n Note: If you turn the light on manually and the
    motion sensor detects motion the light will turn off automatically. It is recommended
    to use the \"Trigger Sensor By-pass\" option if you would like to keep the lights
    ON or OFF for extended time periods.\n \n Required = *\n \n **Need help?** See
